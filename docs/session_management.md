# Session Management in Prompt Sentinel

Session management in Prompt Sentinel allows users to maintain context and state across multiple interactions with language models (LLMs). This feature is particularly useful for applications that require continuity, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or multi-step workflows.

## Purpose of Session Management

Session management provides the following benefits:
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain context across multiple interactions with the LLM.
- **State Tracking**: Track and manage the state of conversations or workflows.
- **Enhanced Security**: Ensure that sensitive data is handled securely within a session.

## Using Sessions

Sessions can be created and managed using the `Session` class in Prompt Sentinel. Below is an example of how to use sessions in your application.

### Example Usage

```python
from sentinel import Session

# Create a new session
session = Session(session_id="user123")

# Add messages to the session
session.add_message({"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather today?"})
session.add_message({"role": "assistant", "content": "The weather is sunny with a high of 25Â°C."})

# Retrieve messages from the session
messages = session.get_messages()
for message in messages:
    print(f"{message['role']}: {message['content']}")

# Clear the session
session.clear()
```

## Features of Session Management

- **Message History**: Store and retrieve the history of messages exchanged during a session.
- **Session IDs**: Use unique session IDs to identify and manage individual sessions.
- **Integration with Detectors**: Automatically sanitize and restore sensitive data within session messages.

## Customizing Sessions

You can customize session behavior by extending the `Session` class. For example, you can implement a custom session storage mechanism to persist session data across application restarts.

### Example: Custom Session Storage

```python
from sentinel import Session

class PersistentSession(Session):
    def __init__(self, session_id, storage_backend):
        super().__init__(session_id)
        self.storage_backend = storage_backend

    def save(self):
        # Implement logic to save session data to the storage backend
        pass

    def load(self):
        # Implement logic to load session data from the storage backend
        pass

# Use the custom session class
session = PersistentSession(session_id="user123", storage_backend="database")
```

## Best Practices

- **Use Unique IDs**: Assign unique session IDs to each user or workflow to avoid conflicts.
- **Limit Session Lifetime**: Define a maximum lifetime for sessions to reduce memory usage and enhance security.
- **Secure Sensitive Data**: Ensure that sensitive data within sessions is sanitized and encrypted when necessary.

Session management is a key feature for building robust and secure applications with Prompt Sentinel. By leveraging sessions, you can provide a seamless and secure user experience while maintaining context and state across interactions.
